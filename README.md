# Stock-Trading-Database-Application
Basic GUI application for stock market database, created as a part of the database management course. Frontend used: Tkinter GUI, Backend: MySQL database

This project involves the implementation of a stock exchange database containing
information about some of the top-performing stocks in India (For our project, we
have chosen the NIFTY 50 index). The project consists of a graphical user
interface that has been developed using the tkinter package in python. The database
contains some of the major information required to identify a stock such as its
symbol, share price, total no of shares, net market capitalization, daily percentage
change and industry to which it belongs. The GUI enables the end-user to easily
make modifications in the share details, and also graphs have been implemented
along with the GUI that enables the user to clearly visualize the key-components of
the data, in a clear and precise manner.

## Tools Used
- Tkinter for GUI (Frontend)
- SQLite3 for database(backend)
- MatPlotLib for plotting Graphs
- Python 3.7

## Functionalities
The project involves implementation of basic functionalities such as insert, update ,
delete operations on the stocks database, and provides the user with an interactive
GUI to easily make changes in it. The project also has functionalities like
username and password implemented for login functionality, allows the end-user to
purchase shares by entering his credentials, and also has a log table, which
describes the various operations that have been made in the database. The project
also has triggers to ensure the integrity of the database, and also lets the user, view
all his past transactions and analyze the data before making another purchase. The
